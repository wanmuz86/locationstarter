Location Starter Code ADA

1) The challenge is to add the distance of every location in your HTML.
2) Identify the nearest mall from your current location.
3) Add an indicator in your HTML that it is the nearest location, eg: adding a border to the div.

Finally, style the CSS as nice as possible :)

Good Luck!
